# Gutted Apostrophe

WARNING: Heavily Under Change Currently.

This is a gutted version of apostrophe. The following changes have been made so
far (more will come as we make this into a good starting point)

## Development Stuff

* Sane `nodemon` settings for frustration free development
* `npm start` to run nodemon correctly.

## Frontend Stuff

* Colors stripped from less files.
* Homepage template simplified.
* Default page template simplified.

## To Get Started.

Basic getting started with this repo steps.

1. clone this repo
1. `npm install` to install dependencies.
1. `node app apostrophe:reset` to create the database structure.
1. `npm start` to run nodemon which will automatically restart when files are
   changed.
